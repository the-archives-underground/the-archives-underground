It is a common complaint in-game and in the forums about how hard it is to get partners for healing rituals. Even if you find a partner, where can you go to perform the ritual in safety? How many times have each of us been all set for a healing ritual and have someone come along and wipe out our creatures and our VE? Every player of Magic Duel has experienced this many times.

Thus, the main purpose of the Dojo is to provide a safe place to do things like:

- Perform healing rituals.
- Set rituals so your defenses and attacks are in place before you wander off into the battle zone.
- Duel with other players, practicing and evolving rituals and strategies for different situations.
- Learn from other players and see their ideas in action.
- Engage in duels to increase or lower you honor or to upgrade your creatures.
- Attend lectures on rituals and strategies.

We believe that over time the Dojo will become a gathering place. A place for players to hang out, similar to the sanctuary. As more and more players congregate at the Dojo, it becomes increasingly likely that you will be able to find healing or a fight anytime you need or want it. We believe that eventually the days where you have to repeatedly beg for a healing ritual will become a thing of the past.

To work, the Dojo seems to need consistent, visible staffing. Dojo staff will be available to participate in healing, explain the purpose and rules of the Dojo, answer questions for newcomers, etc. We are not LHOs (live help operators). Out primary purpose is to make sure people know about and respect the rules of the Dojo, and to keep things orderly.

Mur has indicated that the Dojo staff constitute an informal alliance with Calyx of Isis as its present leader. Those who demonstrate a consistent commitment to maintenance of the Dojo will be invited to become members of the staff. Those who accept the invitation will be given a title under their name so that other players may recognize them and respect their status as representatives of the Dojo.

Dojo Locations
--------------

- Marble Dale Park in Marind Bell
- Gates of Marind Bell in No Man’s land
- Defensive Quarters in Loreroot

Dojo Rules
----------

1. Ask for and receive permission before attacking anyone.
    1. During a heads contest a player with seven (7) or more heads may be attacked at any time. (The Dojo is no safer than an official sanctuary.)
    2. Idle players may be attacked only if the have left word that attacks are ok. If in doubt, do not attack.
2. Violations of rule 1 should be handled diplomatically. Assume a player is ignorant the first time a non-consensual attack. Repeat violators should be reported to Dojo staff
3. This is a school. While in the Dojo, attackers should copy battle logs and PM them to defenders.

Important Notice
----------------

Although the Dojo is a safe zone, combat does occur. In these locations, you must ask before attacking. Some may use the Sanctity of the Dojo to avoid combat, others will use it to structure combat so they can learn something from the combat. I use the word ***dueling*** to describe **combat by consent**.

Suggestions of things you can do in the Dojo
--------------------------------------------

- Participate in healing rituals even when you don’t need healing.
- Ask some to duel with you. Decide in advance what creatures will be used in offense and defense. Try to figure out how to get a victory, not a simple win.
- Ask someone to duel with you to lower or raise your honor. I’ve gotten over 1200 honor just by asking.
- Practice getting victories. Even when you know the defensive ritual, judging the offensive ritual and amount of VE to share is very tricky, but may be learned. You must lose at least 15% VE, but not much more.
- Create a stack of defensive rituals so you can walk about without being concerned about unwanted attacks,

FAQs
----

- **Is it ok to attack idle players in the Dojo?**
    
    You must ask. Players who wished to be attacked generally say something before going idle. Someone in the crowd will likely know and Dojo staff try to keep track of these players. If you can’t get a positive reply, please allow people regenerate their VE while in the Dojo.
- **Marble Dale is a good place to fight. Now people are hiding there.**

    Well, simply ask for the fight. Offer to trade wins, or to remain long enough to heal your partner and yourself.
